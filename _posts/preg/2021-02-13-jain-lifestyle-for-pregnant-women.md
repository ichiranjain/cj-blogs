# Jain Lifestyle for Pregnant Women

```
Wake up at 5 AM in morning
Chant Namokar mantra right when you are in bed. Don't just chant but also imagine panch parmeshthi in mind, and also remember their qualities.
Think about 12 (barah) bhavna
Sweep floor in kitchen while taking care you aren't killing any insect or ants
Clean gas stove and safely remove ants pr insects from over it, if any
Filter water for bath and luke warm it, if it's winter and you need hot water for bath
Take bath and use as much as less water as you can
Wear clean bright clothes.
Do pratah kaal (early morning) Jinendra vandna at home and then do Pratah kaal (early morning) samayik. Before doing Samayik take oath that until your samayik is completed you have tyag (sacrifice) of 4 types of aahar, and everything except clothes and accessories you wore and place you occupied while doing samayiksgaino Digambar Jain temple,
While entering temple, speak nissahi 3 times which means at the time of worship you leave attachment from all worldly things and work.
Just think in mind with gratitude that due to some great karma you got an opportunity to enter Digambar Jain temple, it is the biggest success of your life, your body has become blessed that you got an opportunity to worship Vitragi Jinendra God.
Speak Jai ho, 3 times, then join hands and speak Namokar mantra and other stutis
Watch abhishek and do pooja with asht (8) dhravya. Don't just chant pooja as a part of daily routine but understand each line and do it with full dedication and wholeheartedly. After pooja also do bhaktamar and other stutis if get time
After returning home prepare healthy, pure Jain, nutritious food or get it prepared by someone. Only have filtered water.
Avoid all kinds of food suggested as abhakshya in Jain scriptures
Before having food don't forget to remember Lord Jinendra. Have feeling in your mind that in nect birth you get an opportunity to give aahar to Samyak Dhrasti monk everyday before you have your meals daily.
Don't have too spicy and hot and unhealthy or oily food
Peacefully have your healthy Jain nutritious meal
After completing chores, read Jain scriptures in afternoon
Have your dinner before 6 pm. Don't have anything thereafter.
Go to Jain temple in evening and do samayik
Before going to bed think about 12 bhavna
Speak Namokar mantra and say that as long as you are sleeping, you have tyag (sacrifice) of 4 types of aahar and except the bed you occupy and clothes and accessories you wore, nothing belongs to you
Think positively always
Don't have any negative feelings like anger guilt or resentment, etc. Don't speak lie or manipulate. Don't get angry, depressed or anxious if things don't turn out the way you want.
Always smile at everyone and remain active
Don't watch TV at all and only use phone for necessary calls. Don't use social media except to read about Jainism.
Don't worship or appreciate kudev, kuguru or kushashtra
